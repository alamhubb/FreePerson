Build a virtual world without geographical restrictions


Our world does not have free immigration due to the control of immigration by developed countries.


We accept people from all over the world. For a better life and a better world, we gather here to create a country without geographical restrictions.

Created based on the concept of web3

Development plan

1. Issue national basic income to each citizen who joins the [FreePerson] country, 1,000 free coins per day. Free coins are an inflationary coin, and the number increases every day. The growth number is the national basic income + national contribution income. If you register on the official website, you can receive 1,000 free coins every day. Inflation coins have no practical significance in the short term. The people in the country need to vote on how to treat this coin. There will be a corresponding non-inflationary coin

Complete the official website of the [FreePerson] country before October 25, 2024, support registration and receive national basic income

2. Provide income for everyone who builds the country

3. Adopt a democratic representative system

4. Compared with other modern countries that pursue national interests and national interests, we pursue the interests of international people and people of the world more. Of course, the interests of our own people are the first, but we will consider the development of people of the world more.
